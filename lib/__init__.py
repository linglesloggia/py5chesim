This library is designed for the development of schedulers. 

The final development of the schedulers is subject to the user. This library was born from the 
py5chesim project, which is the work of Gabriela Pereyra developed for the "Facultad de Ingeniería" UdeLaR.
The user must carry out the implementation using algorithms and tools provided by the py5chesim simulator.

For the development of intrasliche schedulers, the C{resAlloc} method must be modified within a new 
class of scheduler, following the requirements documented in this library. An example of its use is 
already incorporated in C{Scheds_intra.py}

This library was developed by "Facultad de Ingeniería - UdeLaR" for the project called Artificial Intelligence applied to 5G networks (2020 -)
Whose coordinators are: Claudina Rattaro, Pablo Belzarena.
Project funded by the National Research and Innovation Agency (ANII)
